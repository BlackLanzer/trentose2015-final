# sprint2
The changes in this sprint are minimal. We essentially added new questions to the game (*see data.js*).
If you structured your code well enough, no changes will even be needed!.


* BONUS: Santa gives you an extra point for being a good developer! *
Create a branch bonus, and change the game so that:
- the game doesn't move to the next question until the user replies correctly
- if the user choses the wrong answer is penalised with a point (-1)
